index.html is the html for the days of the week map.  It connects with the static folder

index-cluster.html connects with the static-cluster folder

The crimes and streetlights folders contain the files (html, js, css) for generating the initial maps of crimes and streetlights 

app.py is the flask app it connects with 
our postgresql data base.

crimes.ipynb contains the code for importing json into pandas and cleaning it up, then generatig a postgres database.

makin sql convert our pandas db to and sqlite database.
